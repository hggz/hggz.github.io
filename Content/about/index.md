# About

Hi! My name is Hugo A. Gonzalez and this is my website written in Swift.
<br/>
I like hard problems, good tools, and creating both. 
<br/>
I value elegant solutions and appreciate the fine beauty in detail. 
<br/>
In my spare time, I build projects and art, and post to my blog rather infrequently. I also like to figure out how things work from their lowest level.
<br/>
As far as my day jobs go, you can get the full story on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-gonzalez-56041186).
